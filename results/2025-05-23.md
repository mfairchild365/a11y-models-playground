| GPT 4.1 | 🚫 Fail | 0 | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/basic-form.gpt4.1.html) | No h1 (but this doesn't fail WCAG). No focus indicator for checkboxes. Checkboxes are misaligned (not a WCAG failure). Error text is not programmatically associated with form controls. Etc. |

| GPT 4.1 | 🚫 Fail | 0 | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/custom-datepicker.gpt-4.1.html) | No h1 (but this doesn't fail WCAG). Date picker table/grid is missing table/grid semantics (no header/row associations). The date picker is technically keyboard accessible, but is far from optimal. For example, it doesn't support arrow navigation, it doesn't close on escape, etc. |
| o4-mini | 🚫 Fail | 1 | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/custom-datepicker.o4-mini.html) |  1 color contrast issue found for the submit button. No h1 (but this doesn't fail WCAG). Date picker doesn't work for anyone - it's not even mouse accessible. |

| GPT 4.1 | 👍 mostly helpful | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/analyze-datepicker.gpt-4.1.md) | Most bugs were identified. It however incorrectly identified some SCs as failing. For example, it said that the user name missing a label fails 1.3.1 and 3.3.2. However, it's 4.1.2 that fails since the input doesn't have an acc name. There is a label - it's just not programmaically associated. It also called out some coding and usability best practices which don't technically fail WCAG. It also says that disabled dates fail contrast when no disabled dates are actually shown. Etc. |
| o4-mini | 😐 somewhat helpful | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/analyze-datepicker.o4-mini.md) | Many bugs were identified. However, it called out the missing h1 as failing both 2.4.6 and 2.4.10 which is not accurate. It also says that disabled dates fail contrast when no disabled dates are actually shown. Etc. |
