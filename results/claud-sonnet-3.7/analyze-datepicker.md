# WCAG Accessibility Issues in the Date Picker Implementation

I've reviewed the datepicker.html file and identified several WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) issues that should be addressed:

## 1. Keyboard Accessibility Issues

- **Missing keyboard navigation for the calendar**: The date picker can only be opened by clicking, and calendar dates can only be selected by mouse clicks. This violates WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard).
- **Improper tabindex attribute**: The input field has `tabindex=1`, which disrupts the natural tab order of the page. Use `tabindex="0"` instead or remove it completely.
- **No keyboard controls** for navigating between days, months, and years in the calendar.

## 2. Semantic Markup Issues

- **Incorrect HTML structure**: Line 86 has an opening `<span>` tag but a closing `</label>` tag.
- **Missing label for email field**: The email input lacks a proper `<label>` element with associated text.
- **No button role** for the date picker trigger: The input opens the calendar but isn't properly identified as having this interactive function.

## 3. Focus Management Issues

- **No visual focus indicator** for keyboard navigation within the date picker.
- **Focus is not trapped inside the calendar** when it's open, allowing users to tab away from the calendar without closing it.
- **No focus management** when the calendar closes (focus should return to the input field).

## 4. ARIA and Semantic Role Issues

- **Missing ARIA attributes** for the date picker widget:
  - No `aria-haspopup="dialog"` on the input field
  - No `role="dialog"` or `aria-modal="true"` on the calendar popup
  - No `aria-label` for navigation buttons (only shows "<" and ">")

## 5. Text and Visual Presentation Issues

- **Low contrast** for the header text (color: #ababab) against white background, which fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast).
- **No error handling or messaging** for invalid date selections.
- **Date format in input field** may not be clear to all users without explicit guidance.

## 6. Screen Reader Support Issues

- **No announcement** when the calendar is opened or closed.
- **Missing alternative text descriptions** for calendar functions.
- **No announcement of the currently selected date** or the current month being viewed.

## 7. Structure and Functionality Issues

- **No explicit instructions** for how to use the date picker.
- **Calendar behavior is not predictable** - opening and closing methods are inconsistent (click to open, click outside to close).
- **No support for direct input** of dates in the field (input is readonly).

## 8. Form Submission Issues

- **No validation feedback** for the date field before form submission.
- **No ability to change format preferences** for users from different locales.

## Recommendations to Fix These Issues:

1. Implement full keyboard support for the date picker:
   - Arrow keys for navigation between days
   - Page Up/Down for months
   - Home/End for first/last day of month
   - Escape to close the picker

2. Add proper ARIA attributes:
   ```html
   <input 
     type="text" 
     id="dob" 
     name="dob" 
     aria-haspopup="dialog" 
     aria-label="Date of birth"
     placeholder="Select your date (MM/DD/YYYY)">
   <div id="datepicker" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-label="Date picker">
   ```

3. Fix semantic markup and add proper labels for all form fields.

4. Improve focus management to ensure keyboard users can navigate the entire component.

5. Add screen reader announcements for calendar actions using `aria-live` regions.

6. Enhance the visual design with better contrast ratios and clear focus indicators.

7. Allow direct input of dates with appropriate validation and format guidance.

These improvements would help make the date picker accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies, in compliance with WCAG standards.
