| Model | sentiment | # axe errors | output | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPT 4.1 | ðŸš« Fail | 0 | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/custom-datepicker.gpt-4.1.html) | No h1 (but this doesn't fail WCAG). Date picker table/grid is missing table/grid semantics (no header/row associations). The date picker is technically keyboard accessible, but is far from optimal. For example, it doesn't support arrow navigation, it doesn't close on escape, etc. |
| o4-mini | ðŸš« Fail | 1 | [outout](/results/2025-05-23/custom-datepicker.o4-mini.html) |  1 color contrast issue found for the submit button. No h1 (but this doesn't fail WCAG). Date picker doesn't work for anyone - it's not even mouse accessible. |
